        Jupyter notebooks are a popular tool in digital teaching. However, its use in a course is
        not trivial, because in order to provide each course participant with his or her own
        notebook, a technical solution is needed to create these notebooks. In addition,
        authentication and authorization must take place.

        JupyterHub provides a common solution for these requirements. But providing your own
        JupyterHub is not trivial either and presents further hurdles.

        That's where <strong>JupyterHub as a Service</strong> comes in: a simple solution to create
        course-related JupyterHubs with just a few clicks.

        As a course owner, you easily create a request for a JupyterHub. The governance decides
        whether the request is approved. If it is approved, you will receive an invitation link that
        you can distribute among the course participants. They follow the invitation and apply for
        the JupyterHub. After an approvel by you, the participants can use their Jupyter notebooks
        on your JupyterHub.
